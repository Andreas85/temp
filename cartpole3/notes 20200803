I'm sorry for not writing sooner. But I'm not in a good place mentally. I have a lot of anxiety and not just from the solo episode. When I try to get myself to do it anyway I get so angry at myself, I start hating myself as a fucking faggot and if I keep trying anyway I will start to hit myself in the head. I've been able to get myself to do it anyway but then I'm still just a fucking faggot and now I'm extremely tensed up.
